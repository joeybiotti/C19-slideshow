### I tried to used NASA's API, but as of this commit, it hasn't been successful.

I played around with Bootstrap a bit. Tossed in some glyphicons just to see how they work. They serve no purpose (nor do the buttons they're on), and  most likely will be removed by the final commit. Or not. I haven't decided yet.

I went down a bit of a Sass/CSS wormhole as well. Sadly, it's still not pretty because I have no sense of style.

So, in other words, the only thing that matters with this whole exercise, the AJAX request, doesn't work and there's a bunch of CSS styling that looks halfway decent. Whoops. At least my markdowns are getting longer and more detailed (read: inane). Putting that English degree to work!
